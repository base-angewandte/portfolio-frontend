The data consists of a single JSON object which includes JSON-LD context information (in the `@context` field) and one or more fields which contain the actual data. Some methods (`data`) return other formats (RDF/XML, Turtle, RDF/JSON) with the appropriate MIME type.\r\n\r\nThe API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing by setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header to `\"*\"` for all requests.\r\n\r\nThe API supports the JSONP convention of appending a callback parameter to any URL.
